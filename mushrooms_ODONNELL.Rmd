When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(readr)
mushrooms <- read_csv("mushroom_dataset.csv")
```
```{r}
#renaming column 1
names(mushrooms)[1]<-"class"
```

```{r}
#checking data types for all columns
str(mushrooms)
```

```{r}
#change values for the class column
mushrooms$class[mushrooms$class == 'e'] <- 'edible'
mushrooms$class[mushrooms$class == 'p'] <- 'poisonous'
```

```{r}
#figuring out what the second column is...
unique((mushrooms)[2])
```
```{r}
#renaming column 2
names(mushrooms)[2]<-"cap-shape"
```

```{r}
#figuring out what the third column is...
unique((mushrooms)[3])
```

```{r}
#renaming column 3
names(mushrooms)[3]<-"cap-surface"
```

```{r}
#figuring out what the fourth column is...
unique((mushrooms)[4])
```

```{r}
#renaming column 4
names(mushrooms)[4]<-"cap-color"
```

```{r}
#subsetting the dataframe
mushrooms = mushrooms[,1:4]
head(mushrooms, 3)
```
